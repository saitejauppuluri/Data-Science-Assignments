    ## Analysis Summary - Frailty Data

    - Average Grip Strength (Frail): 23.50 kg
    - Average Grip Strength (Non-Frail): 27.67 kg

    **Observation:** 
    - Non-frail individuals tend to have a higher average grip strength.
    - Frail individuals show lower grip strength, which supports the hypothesis that reduced physical strength is correlated with frailty.
