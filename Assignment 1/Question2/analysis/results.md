    ## Visualizations and Analysis

    ### 1. Distribution of Math Scores
    - **File:** math_score_distribution.png
    - Most students score between 60 and 80.
    - There are a few students with much lower scores, but overall performance is fairly balanced.

    ### 2. Parental Education Level vs Math Score
    - **File:** parent_education_vs_math_score.png
    - Students whose parents have higher education (college degree or higher) tend to have slightly better math scores.
    - However, the differences between groups are not very large, meaning parental education is not the only factor.

    ### 3. Average Math Score by Lunch Type
    - **File:** lunch_vs_math_score.png
    - Students who receive standard lunch (indicating better economic background) tend to score higher on average.
    - This suggests economic factors may play a role in performance.

    ### 4. Test Preparation Course Completion vs Math Score
    - **File:** test_prep_vs_math_score.png
    - Students who completed a test preparation course tend to have slightly better scores.
    - Some students who did not complete the course still scored high, so test prep helps, but it’s not the only factor.

    ---

    ### 5. Average Math Score by Gender
    - **File:** gender_vs_math_score.png
    - Male and female students have very similar average math scores.
    - There is no strong evidence of a gender gap in math performance based on this dataset.

    ## Conclusion

    These visualizations helped us understand how different factors might influence student performance. Without these plots, spotting these patterns would have been much harder. By summarizing data visually, we could quickly identify trends related to parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and gender.
